              Working on a client project I was asked to recreate a legacy tool utilized by the University which acts as a centralized
              hub for job aids, resources, templates, and modals. I was asked to modernize the tool making the application
              responsive and mobile friendly. Throughout the project I had the opportunity to act as UX, designer, and sole
              programmer. The tech stack I used for the project was HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap 4, and two JavaScript
              Plugins: MixItUp3 and Magnific Popup. The project showcased resembles the final build, however what’s shown
              is a mockup.

              While attending Bootcamp I was tasked with creating a fully functional game of Tic Tac Toe using the Ruby programming language.
              The user has the ability to play against the computer in three varying difficulties: Easy, Medium or Hard.
              During this process I was introduced to coding methodologies ranging from but not limited to Test-Driven Development,
              Object-Oriented Design, Pair Programming, Algorithms and much more. Feeling lucky? Play the computer on the
              hard difficulty. Don't say I didn't warn you.

              Wanting to better understand web design I created a fictional food delivery site from concept to production. With the aide
              of a Udemy course I learned how to create proper HTML5 semantics able to successfully pass validation, how
              to create attention grabbing CSS3 using animation, how to use both JavaScript and jQuery to create user-interface
              functionality, the importance of user accessibility across multiple platforms, how to create custom responsive
              web design using media queries, how to optimize media so that the site responds quickly and how to use keywords
              and meta tags to maximize search engine optimization.

              There’s no question jQuery can help developers traverse the DOM more easily by simplifying common tasks such as DOM manipulation.
              However recent updates to JavaScript have made many developers reconsider using jQuery, a large library where
              most functionality while useful goes unused. Throughout this project I learned how to manipulate the DOM using
              vanilla JavaScript creating a stylish game where the user attempt to pick a color based on RGB values.

              If you’re a developer you understand the never ending list of todos, so what better way to keep track of what activities
              still need completed, not to mention feel accomplished when a todo is marked complete than through a custom
              built To-Do application? Throughout this project I used jQuery to manipulate the DOM creating a To-Do application

            I moved to Pittsburgh shortly after graduating college at Penn State where I received a B.S. in Business. While I've spent
            a large portion of my professional career working in several business-related roles I've always found myself
            drawn to technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            With an unquenchable thirst to learn new things, I decided to pursue a career change. In August of 2016, I attended a coding
            bootcamp, completing a 16-week intensive Full Stack Web Development curriculum. Throughout the Bootcamp, I learned
            programming fundamentals using the Ruby programming language, how to build state of the art web pages and desktop
            applications, and most importantly how to think like a programmer.
          </p>
          <!-- <p>
            After completing the bootcamp I had the opportunity to work as a Software Apprentice. Over the course of a 5-month period,
            I worked on several client projects and had the privilege to student teach.
          </p> -->
          <p>
            I currently work as a Software Developer at
            <a href="https://www.walltowall.com/" target="_blank">Wall-to-Wall Studios</a> where I spend the majority of my days working on websites and applications using HTML5,
            CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, React, WordPress and several third-party libraries.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding you can find me out on the trails running with my pup Waffle Nuggets, enjoying the company of my two
            cats Nacho Donut and Kratos Flying Pie, riding my Peleton that or eating pizza with my lovely partner in crime!
          </p>
          <!-- <p>
            Recently I accepted a Software Engineer role where I specialize in frontend/UI working on enterprise level projects using
            HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, TypeScript, jQuery, and Angular. I also act as an Assistant Instructor for

            John has a true passion for learning new technology and problem solving which makes him an obvious choice for any software
            engineering position. His programming skills are incredibly sharp and he has a knack for identifying problems
            within an application and coming up with solutions that are both maintainable and scalable.

            Without John's expertise both in web development and as an instructor, our teaching would not have been nearly as effective.
            John was an invaluable asset to me as an instructor, he's a brilliant and creative developer, and he's a deeply
            involved and caring team member. I can't recommend him highly enough.

            John's dedication to his work is unparalleled. His creativity, passion, curiosity, and professionalism enhanced my classroom
            each week and directly affected the class culture in a highly positive way. John is always willing to learn more,
            do more, and contribute more to the end result.
